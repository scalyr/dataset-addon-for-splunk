#  DataSet Add-on for Splunk
The DataSet Add-on for Splunk provides integration with [DataSet](https://www.dataset.com) by [SentinelOne](https://sentinelone.com). The key functions allow two-way integration:
- SPL custom command to query DataSet directly from the Splunk UI without having to reindex data to Splunk.
- Inputs to index alerts as CIM-compliant, or user-defined query results, from DataSet to Splunk.
- Alert action to send events from Splunk to DataSet.

## Installation
The included .tgz file is ready for installation in Splunk. The package subdirectory contains all artifacts. To compile, reference Splunk's [UCC Framework instructions](https://splunk.github.io/addonfactory-ucc-generator/how_to_use/) to use `ucc-gen` and `slim package`.

Reference Splunk documentation for [installing add-ons](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Installingadd-ons).

### Splunk Enterprise
| Splunk component | Required | Comments |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Search heads | Yes | Required to use the custom search command. |
| Indexers | No | Parsing is performed during data collection. | 
| Forwarders | Yes | For distributed deployments, this add-on requires heavy forwarders for modular inputs. |

### Splunk Cloud
| Splunk component | Required | Comments |

![Configuring DataSet Account](README_images/setup_account.png)

2. In configuration on DataSet Account tab:
- Select the environment.

4. Click Save.

![Setup new input](README_images/setup_new_input.png)

5. On the inputs page, click Create New Input and select the desired input

![Setup alerts indexing](README_images/setup_alerts.png)

6. For DataSet alerts, enter:
- A name for the input.
- Interval, in seconds. A good starting point is `300` seconds to collect every five mintues.
- Splunk index name
- Start time, in relative shorthand form, e.g.: `24h` for 24 hours before input execution time.
7. Click Save.

![Setup query indexing](README_images/setup_query.png)

7. For DataSet queries, enter:
- A name for the input.
- Interval, in seconds. A good starting point is `300` seconds to collect every five mintues.
- Splunk index name
- Start time, in relative shorthand form, e.g.: `24h` for 24 hours before input execution time.
- *(optional)* End time, in relative shorthand form, e.g.: `5m` for 5 minutes before input execution time.
- *(optional)* Query string used to return matching events.
- *(optional)* Maximum number of events to return.

## Using

### Inputs
The DataSet Add-on for Splunk collects the following inputs utilizing time-based checkpointing to prevent reindexing the same data:

| Source Type | Description | CIM Data Model |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| dataset:alerts | Predefined Power Query API call to index [alert state change records](https://app.scalyr.com/help/alerts#logging)  | [Alerts](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/Alerts) |
| dataset:query | User-defined standard [query](https://app.scalyr.com/help/api#query) API call to index events | - |

## SPL Command
The `| dataset` command allows queries against the DataSet API directly from Splunk's search bar. Optional parameters are supported:

- **method** - Define `query`, `powerquery` or `timeseries` to call the appropriate REST endpoint. Default is query.
- **query** - The DataSet [query](https://app.scalyr.com/help/query-language) or filter used to select events. Default is no filter (return all events limited by maxCount).
- **maxcount** - Number of events to return from DataSet query or powerquery. Default is 100. Not used for timeseries.
- **starttime** - The Splunk time picker can be used (not "All Time"), but if starttime is defined it will take precedence to define the [start time](https://app.scalyr.com/help/time-reference) for DataSet events to return. Use epoch time or relative shorthand in the form of a number followed by d, h, m or s (for days, hours, minutes or seconds), e.g.: `24h`. Default is 24h.
- **endtime** - The Splunk time picker can be used (not "All Time"), but if endtime is defined it will take precedence to define the [end time](https://app.scalyr.com/help/time-reference) for DataSet events to return. Use epoch time or relative shorthand in the form of a number followed by d, h, m or s (for days, hours, minutes or seconds), e.g.: `5m`. Default is current time at search.

For timeseries queries, additional parameters include:
- **function** - Define value to compute from matching events. Default is rate.
- **buckets** - The number of numeric values to return by dividing time range into equal slices. Default is 1.
- **createsummaries** - Specify whether to create summaries to automatically update on ingestion pipeline. Default is true, *be sure to set to false for one-off or while testing new queries*.
- **useonlysummaries** - Specify whether to only use preexisting timeseries for fastest speed.

For all queries, be sure to `"`wrap the entire query in double quotes`"`, and inside use `'`single quotes`'` or double quotes `\"`escaped with a backslash`\"`, as shown in the following examples.

Query Example:
`| dataset method=query search="serverHost = * AND Action = 'allow'" maxcount=50 starttime=10m endtime=1m`

Power Query Example 1: `| dataset method=powerquery search="dataset = \"accesslog\"
| group requests = count(), errors = count(status == 404) by uriPath
| let rate = errors / requests
| filter rate > 0.01
| sort -rate"`

![SPL Power Query example](README_images/spl_powerquery.png)

Power Query Example 2: `| dataset method=powerQuery search="$serverHost == 'cloudWatchLogs' 
| parse 'RequestId: $RID$ Duration: $DUR$ ms Billed Duration: $BDUR$ ms Memory Size: $MEM$ MB Max Memory Used: $UMEM$ MB' 
| let deltaDUR= BDUR - DUR, deltaMEM = MEM - UMEM 
| sort -DUR 
| columns 'Request ID' = RID, 'Duration(ms)' = DUR, 'Charged delta (ms)' = deltaDUR, 'Used Memory (MB)' = UMEM, 'Charged delta Memory (MB)' = deltaMEM" starttime=5m`

Since events are returned in JSON format, the Splunk [spath command](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/SearchReference/Spath) is useful. Additionally, the Splunk [collect command](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/collect) can be used to add the events to a summary index:

```
| dataset query="serverHost = * AND Action = 'allow'" maxcount=50 starttime=10m endtime=1m
| spath
| collect index=dataset
```

Timeseries Query Example:
```
| dataset method=timeseries search="serverHost='scalyr-metalog'" function="p90(delayMedian)" starttime="24h" buckets=24 createsummaries=false onlyusesummaries=false
```

## Alert Action
An alert action allows sending an event to the DataSet [addEvents API](https://app.scalyr.com/help/api#addEvents).
