    Attributes:
        operator (Union[Unset, FacetFnOperator]): Operator applied on an expression.

            `count` - the number of samples in each time period

            `countPerSecond` - the number of samples per second (mean across each time period)

            `max` - the maximum sample in each time period

            `mean` - the mean of all samples in each time period

            `min` - the minimum sample in each time period

            `p` - the nth percentile of all samples, n is supplied as the param value whose's magnitude can be anywhere
            between 0 and 1.

            `p10` - the 10th percentile of all samples in each time period

            `p50` - the median of all samples in each time period

            `p90` - the 90th percentile of all samples in each time period

            `p95` - the 95th percentile of all samples in each time period

            `p99` - the 99th percentile of all samples in each time period

            `p999` - the 99.9th percentile of all samples in each time period

            `sum` - the sum of all time-series in each time period

            `sumPerSecond` - the sum of all time-series in each time period, divided by the number of seconds covered
        param (Union[Unset, float]): Statistical parameter to be used in conjunction with the operator.

            This is largely applicable for the percentile operators i.e. for p10 this param would 0.1.
